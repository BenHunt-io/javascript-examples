# Demos of the JavaScript and Typescript Languages

Author: https://benhunt.io/

This repository consists of a set of annotated demos of the JavaScript and TypeScript languages. Most of the programs will be ran through as live demos for [Open Lending](https://www.openlending.com/)  and will be recorded for replay and available online, (link TBD). The demos are structured roughly the same as [javascript.info](https://javascript.info/). Most of demos are created from distilling out the important information from [javascript.info](https://javascript.info/) and presenting it in an experimentable format. Huge shoutout to that site, they are doing a service for humanity.
