## Functions

JavaScript has first-class function support.

In programming language design, a first-class citizen (also type, object, entity, or value) 
in a given programming language is an entity which supports all the operations generally 
available to other entities. These operations typically include being passed as an argument, 
returned from a function, modified, and assigned to a variable. [First Class Citizens Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-class_citizen)
